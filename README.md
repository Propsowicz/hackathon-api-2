# Silevis World Cup 2022 Hackathon :soccer::star:

## Project

The task chosen by our team was to create a web application to collect and compare statistics of football players. 

The setup of our team forced us to create two RestAPI backends and work in the microservices architecture. 

The frontend was created in TSReact. Backends was created in NestJS [user managment] and Python [data managment].

## Primary Plan

The plan was to create a web application in which the user could find a player's profile, check his statistics, analyze the data, and finally compare him with another player.

The user should be able to create an account, manage it and pin their favorite players. It was also planned to create a subscription model for using the application,

and transfer user data between backends via JWT.

## Results

Although our project did not win the competition, it was highly appreciated by other teams. :muscle:

Nevertheless, two members of our team were awarded individually. [Adriskk](https://github.com/Adriskk) was recognized for his frontend skills, and I was recognized for my team leadership and communication skills. 

## My role

My task was to create a backend in Python. I used the Django (DRF) framework. The database was SQlite3. The backend endpoint was deployed to the cloud service (render.com).

The data was randomly created by a simple script included in my backend.

My job was not only to collect data, but also to analyze it and finally send it to the frontend. 

I was able to analyze data using numpy and pandas libraries.
