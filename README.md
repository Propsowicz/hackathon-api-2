# Silevis World Cup 2022 Hackathon 

## Project

Task choosen by our team was to create web application to colect and compare statistics of football players. 

Setup of our team forced us to create two ReatAPI backends and work in microservices architecture. 

Frontend was created in TSReact. Backends was created in NestJS [user managment] and Python [data managment].

## Primary Plan

The plan was to create webapp when user can find a football player profile, check his statisctics, analyze data and, finally, compare him to another player.

User should be able to create account, manage it and pin up his favourites players. There were also a plan to create subscription model of using application, 

and transfer userdata between backends via JWT.

## My role

My job was to create Python backend. I created backend in Django (DRF). Database was SQlite3. Backend's endpoint was doployed on cloud service (render.com).

The data was randomly created by simple script contained in my backend.

My work was not only to colect data, but also made some analyze with it, and, eventually, send it to frontend. 

I was able to analyze data with numpy and pandas libraries.
